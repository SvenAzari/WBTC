WET BULB TEMPERATURE CALCULATOR

Calculate wet-bulb temperature using air temperature and relative air humidity.
This script is written in Python.
You need to have Python3 installed on your computer in order to use this script.
Made by Sven Azari

INSTRUCTIONS:
  1.) TT - air temeperature [°C] - input without decimal point (e.g. 21.8 = 218)
  2.) UU - relative humidity [%]
  3.) BBB - air pressure [hPa] - input without thousand digit and decimal point (e.g 1013.3 = 133 and 995.2 = 9952)
          - if air pressure is unknown just leave it empty - in that case, script will use mean atmospheric pressure at sea level
  4.) HT - calcualted wet-bulb temperature [°C] - printed without decimal point - if calculated value is negative, instead of - sign, there will be W or
      in front of number - W indicates there is water on wet-bulb termomether sensor and I indicates there is ice - value in [] is for wet-bulb temperature
      with ice on bet-bulb termomether sensor
  5.) For exit just type "exit".
  6.) In case of wrong input, type "back".

Requirements: Python3, PySimpleGUI (for GUI version)
